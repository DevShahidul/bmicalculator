## Created BMI Calculator with Vanila javascript and HTML

* The HTML form contains two input fields, one for weight and one for height, and a button with an ID of "calculateBtn".
* The JavaScript code uses document.getElementById to get references to the input fields and the button, and adds an event listener to the button that calls a function named calculateBMI when the button is clicked.
* The calculateBMI function gets the weight and height values from the input fields, calculates the BMI using the formula, and displays the result on the web page using the textContent property of the result element.
